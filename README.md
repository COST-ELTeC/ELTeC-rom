# ELTeC-rom

## Release notes

General information about ELTeC releases is available at https://github.com/COST-ELTeC/ELTeC.

The first iteration illustrates the most representative sub-genres of the novel in the Romanian literary tradition (hajduk, city mystery, and historical) as well as a variety of editorial practices and orthographic standards used between 1840 and 1920. Currently, the ELTeC-rom collection contains novels encoded at level 1. The corpus composition criteria are not yet fully fulfilled.
