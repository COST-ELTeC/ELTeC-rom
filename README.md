# Romanian Novel Collection (ELTeC-rom)

This is the Romanian novel collection for ELTeC, the European Literary Text Collection, produced by the COST Action "Distant Reading for European Literary History" (CA16204, https://distant-reading.net).

## Release notes

General information about ELTeC releases is available at https://github.com/COST-ELTeC/ELTeC.

The current release (v0.6.0) illustrates the most representative sub-genres of the novel in the Romanian literary tradition (hajduk, city mystery, and historical) as well as a variety of editorial practices and orthographic standards used between 1840 and 1920. 

For all novels included in this collection, scanning, OCR, and manual clean-up was performed by the Digital Humanities Laboratory (UAIC), Iasi. Currently, the ELTeC-rom collection contains novels encoded at level 1. The corpus composition criteria are not yet fully fulfilled.
